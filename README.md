The project is a recruitment-focused chatbot powered by machine learning, designed to understand and categorize user responses based on their content. In its current state, the chatbot can interact with users, analyze their messages, and predict the underlying intent of their responses, such as discussing their skills, work experience, or availability.

The system uses a neural network model, trained on a dataset of labeled responses, to identify these intents. The model processes the input text, converts it into numerical data, and predicts the most likely intent along with the probabilities of each potential intent. This not only identifies the primary intent but also provides a measure of confidence for each possible category.

Additionally, the chatbot assigns a score to each response based on the presence of relevant keywords, offering a quantitative assessment of the response's relevance or quality. This scoring system helps in ranking and evaluating candidates more effectively. The entire system is deployed as a web service using FastAPI, making it accessible for real-time interaction. The project demonstrates a blend of natural language processing and web technologies to create a practical tool for recruitment purposes.
